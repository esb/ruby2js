{% rendercontent "docs/note", type: "warning" %}
Heads up: we're in the process of updating and reworking our example code for Ruby2JS 5.1+ and modern bundling tools like esbuild, and also removing deprecated examples such as React. Proceed with caution…
{% endrendercontent %}

Inspiration for ways you might want to use Ruby2JS:

* **[Stimulus Controller for Shoelace Forms & Turbo](https://gist.github.com/jaredcwhite/196f97cafeeaf8e2d5a82c6e9d79a069)** – a controller for submitting Shoelace UI forms via Turbo. In the example provided, both the Ruby2JS source and the JavaScript output are shown (which is helpful for seeing just how human-readable the JS code generated by Ruby2JS is). This could be simplifed even further with the help of the new brand-new [Stimulus filter](/examples/stimulus/).
* **[Simple functions for a static Bridgetown site](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/blob/main/bridgetown-website/frontend/javascript/lib/functions.js.rb)** – just an example of how you could write simple "functions" using Ruby2JS and lambdas instead. Also see how Bridgetown is using `@ruby2js/webpack-loader` within the [Webpack config](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/blob/main/bridgetown-website/webpack.config.js).
