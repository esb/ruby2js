The **Lit** filter makes it easier to build
[LitElement](https://lit.dev/) web components. Here's an example of a component
from Lit's documentation, rewritten in Ruby2JS (and you can inspect the compiled
output to see nearly identical code.)

<div data-controller="combo" data-options='{
  "eslevel": 2022,
  "autoexports": "default",
  "filters": ["esm", "lit", "functions"]
}'></div>

```ruby
class SimpleGreeting < LitElement
  self.styles = <<~CSS
    p { color: blue }
  CSS

  custom_element "simple-greeting"

  def initialize
    @name = "Somebody"
  end

  def render
    <<~HTML
      <p>Hello, #{name}!</p>
    HTML
  end
end
```

## List of Transformations

When a class definition is encountered that derives from
`LitElement`, the following transformations are applied:

 * an `import` statement for LitElement will be generated if the [esm](./esm)
   filter is also applied.

 * instance variables (e.g., `@x`) are **not** mapped to properties prefixed
   with either an underscore (`_`) or a hash (`#`).  

 * References to instance variables will cause entries to be added to the
   `static properties` property if not already present, and simple type
   inferencing will be used to determine the type. (To bypass this for
   truly internal state, use a prefixed ivar name like `@_x`.)

 * `@styles` assignments, `self.styles` assignments and `self.styles` methods
   that return a string will have that string mapped to a
   `css` literal string.  These are three alternate syntaxes to specifying
   [static styles](https://lit.dev/docs/components/styles/).

 * `render` and other methods that return a string will have that string mapped
   to a `html` literal string if that string starts with a less than sign. This
   also applies, recursively, to all interpolated values within that string.
   (For a method where you don't want the `html` literal used, just return a
   string variable or some such statement instead.)

 * Methods referenced within HTML literals are not automatically bound, but
   will be automatically prefixed with `this.`.

 * LitElement inheritance will also automatically prefix inherited properties
   and methods with `this.`, and will autobind inherited methods when
   referenced without any parameters or parenthesis.
     * methods: `performUpdate`,`requestUpdate`
     * properties: `hasUpdated`, `renderRoot`, `shadowRoot`, `updateComplete`

 * `customElement` (or `custom_element`) calls are converted to `customElements.define` calls.

 * `query`, `queryAll`, and `queryAsync` calls are converted to corresponding
   `this.renderRoot.querySelector` calls.

 * If `super` is not called by the `initialize` function, a call to `super`
   will be added.
