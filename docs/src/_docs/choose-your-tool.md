If you simply want to get a job done with a rich Ruby runtime and well-tested
framework, and only use one of the many integrations that
[Opal](https://opalrb.com/) provides, then Opal is the way to go.

**Ruby2JS** is for those that want to produce JavaScript that looks like it
wasnâ€™t machine generated, and want the absolute bare minimum in terms of
limitations as to what JavaScript can be produced.

[Try](/demo?preset=true) for yourself.  
[Compare with Opal](https://opalrb.com/try/#code:).

And, of course, the right solution might be to use
[CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/) instead. ðŸ˜‰
